### Entry points ###

The best entry points into this work are the paper above followed by the [online appendix](https://github.com/secure-compilation/exploring-robust-property-preservation/blob/master/appendix.pdf) in this repo, which includes direct pointers to various Coq and text files.

### Prerequisites for the Coq proofs ###

The Coq development is known to work with Coq v8.7.X, but it has very few dependencies, so it will likely work with other versions as well.
